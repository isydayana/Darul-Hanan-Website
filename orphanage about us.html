  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
Darul Hanan is a truly distinctive charitable organization. Its establishment in 1992 sprang from the sense of responsibility felt by YBhg Puan Sri Datin Noorzilah, the founder and Chairperson, together with her committee members, to strengthen compassion toward the less fortunate and to protect children who have lost their parents.</p>

<p>Through the dedication of its members, the association succeeded in building an orphanage and home for underprivileged children in Pasir Gudang, Johor Bahru, known as Darul Hanan, which means “House of Love and Compassion.” Darul Hanan serves as a source of inspiration for its members in their mission to create a caring and compassionate society.</p>

<p>Construction of the first building began in 1992, and on 10 January 1993, the home welcomed its first intake of 31 girls. Darul Hanan was envisioned as a place of refuge and hope for children in need, providing them with the opportunity to lead better lives while fostering positive family values among themselves. On 21 November 1995, the home admitted its first group of 31 boys. By 2010, Darul Hanan had supported nearly 353 children 203 girls and 154 boys. That same year, 64 children (26 boys and 38 girls) were residing in the home.

  <h2>Our Hope For the Future</h2>
  <p>
At Darul Hanan, we hold a sincere hope to uplift the lives of underprivileged children so they may grow into responsible, capable individuals who can contribute meaningfully to their families, communities, and the nation. We aspire to remain a place of refuge that brings light and comfort to those in need, guiding each child toward a brighter, more complete future. It is also our hope that the values of family, unity, and compassion instilled during their time here will continue to flourish as they move forward in life. We dream of seeing more of our children excel academically and pursue higher education, becoming role models for others. Above all, we hope that more kind-hearted individuals and organisations will come forward to support the Darul Hanan Management Fund through financial or material contributions so that we may continue providing for the daily needs and education of our children.
